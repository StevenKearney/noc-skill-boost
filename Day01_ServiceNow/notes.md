# Day 1 - ServiceNow

## Goals for the day
    
1. Spin up a free ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI)
2. Create a realistic incident
3. Attach an SLA
4. Work through the incident like a NOC technician

## What we'll accomplish

1. Set up a ServiceNow developer account
2. Create a **Network Operations** assignment group, a test "**caller**, and a **CI** (Configuration Item) will will call Router-1
3. Open an **Incident**, set **Impact/Urgency**, decide on a **Priority Level**, and attach an **SLA**
4. Work the ticket from start to finish: **New -> In Progress -> On Hold -> Resolved -> Closed**
5. We will also capture screenshots and write a short **incident report**

## Why this matters in a NOC

* Demonstrates ticket workflow and **documentation**
* Gets us familiar with **SLAs** and how incident reponse works
* Familiarizes us with **ServiceNow**
