🚧 **Work in Progress** — actively updated as I complete each day’s lab.

    🚧 Day 7

This is a **hands-on self-learning program** covering tools and workflows in **ServiceNow**, **Zabbix**, **Graylog**, CLI tools, Bash scripting, network diagramming, and IP planning. 

Each day's topic is designed to be modular, so you can pick and choose what you need to learn.  

🖥️ **Built for aspiring network professionals, by an aspiring network professional** — designed to provide practical, hands-on experience while sharing progress with others.  

This is also my **first GitHub repository**, so I’ll be learning GitHub alongside the core lab topics.
