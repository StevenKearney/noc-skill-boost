# noc-skill-boost

🚧 Work in Progress — actively updated as I complete each day’s lab.

This is a hands-on self-learning program covering tools and workflows in ServiceNow, Zabbix, Graylog, CLI tools, Bash scripting, network diagramming, and IP planning.

It’s **built for aspiring network professionals, by an aspiring network professional** — designed to provide practical, hands-on experience while sharing progress with others.

This is also my first GitHub repository, so I’ll be learning GitHub alongside the core lab topics.

💡 Have recommendations? Fork the repo and submit a pull request — contributions and suggestions are welcome!

This course assumes fundamental knowledge of networking and will not go into details to keep it streamlined.  
It also assumes basic GitHub and general computer skills.
