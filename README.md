# noc-skill-boost

🚧 **Work in Progress** — actively updated as I complete each day’s lab
   * May expand on these labs once complete, not sure yet
```
    🏁 Day 1 - ServiceNow (Incident Management) 
    🏁 Day 2 - Zabbix (Network Monitoring)bix
    🚧 Day 3 - Graylog (Syslog & Log Analysis)
    🚧 Day 4 - Remote Access Tools
    🚧 Day 5 - BASH
    🚧 Day 6 - Network Diagramming
    🚧 Day 7 - IP Address Management
```
🤚 This is a **hands-on self-learning program** covering tools and workflows in **ServiceNow**, **Zabbix**, **Graylog**, CLI tools, Bash scripting, network diagramming, IP planning.

🏗️ Each day's topic is designed to be modular, so you can pick and choose what you need to learn at your own pace. **However**, I recommend not nuking anything you've set up until you are done with the course. We may reference things from prior days, and you might want to practice linking concepts together.

🖥️ Built for aspiring network professionals, by an **aspiring network professional**, this project is designed to provide practical, hands-on learning and experience while sharing progress with others.  

🤓 This is also my **first GitHub repository**, my first time using **Git**, and my first major project using **VS Code**; so I will be learning these applications alongside the core lab topics.  

🐋 We also will be using **Docker** to set up these applications, so we will be learning some docker basics along the way as well. This is not typical of a NOC, but I think it's the most accessible way to get into these systems.

## 📌 Course Requirements

- Fundamental knowledge of networking (no deep dives into basics to keep it streamlined)  
- Basic GitHub navigational knowledge
- Docker Desktop UI for Windows (note: not *required* but the labs will assume you are running it this way and pulling the same images)
- A modern(ish) Windows PC (see note above as well) with standard peripherals and internet access

## 🛠 How to Use This Repo  

### **1. Follow the Daily Labs**  
Each day has its own files and folders (`Day01_ServiceNow`, `Day02_Zabbix`, etc.) containing:
- **summary.md** –  what I learned from creating the lab and running it myself
- **lab.md** – instructions, references, and tips  
- **screenshots/** – visual guide of what I did
- **scripts/** – Bash, CLI, or automation scripts (if applicable)  
- **docs/** – diagrams, IP plans, or other documentation (if applicable)

---

### **2. Work at Your Own Pace**  
- Designed for ~2 hours/day, but flexible to your schedule  
- Includes full setup instructions for each lab

---

### **3. Stay Updated**  
- This repo is actively updated as each lab is completed  
- Use GitHub’s **Watch** feature to get notifications on changes  
- See the **changelog.md** to view changes and progress
